            <h2> Day 10 Work Immersion</h2>
            <div class="days-grid">
             <p>
                 Day 1: We were assigned to create a presentation about another programming language where we had to explain what the language is, 
                 discuss its main purpose, describe how it works, and share important information about its features and uses in the field of.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Day 2: We presented our work in front of the class and explained the programming language we researched, and after the presentation,
                  we were given a new task to design and create a website that functions like a sign-up form where users can enter their personal information 
             </p>
             <p>
                 Day 3: We were assigned to create a login form website that allows users to input their username and password, helping us understand how user 
                 authentication works and how web forms are structured in website development.  
            </p>   
             <p>
                 Day 4: We were assigned to create a homepage for the website that we previously developed, focusing on organizing the layout, adding navigation links, 
                 and making sure the homepage properly connects to the sign-up and login forms.
             </p>
              <p>
                 Day 5: We were tasked with designing the three websites we created by using CSS to improve their appearance, including styling the layout,
                  adjusting colors, modifying fonts, adding spacing, and making the overall design more attractive and user-friendly.
             </p>
             <p>
                  Day 6: We were assigned to use JavaScript to add interactive functions to our websites, 
                  such as form validation and dynamic responses to user actions, which helped make the websites more functional and responsive. On the same day,
                   we also participated in a Bible study session at the company, which allowed us to reflect and learn valuable life lessons.  
             </p>   
             <p>
                  Day 7: We were instructed to convert all the JavaScript code into jQuery,
                   which helped us understand how jQuery simplifies JavaScript functions and makes coding more efficient and easier to manage.
            <p>
                  Day 8: We were assigned to encode important documents and paperwork, which helped us develop our typing accuracy,
                   attention to detail, and ability to organize digital files properly.
            </p> 
            <p>
                 Day 9: We were tasked with creating a personal portfolio that showcases our skills, projects, and experiences,
                  allowing us to present our work in a professional and organized manner.  
            </p>
            <p>
                  Day 10: On our last day, we continued working on and finalizing our portfolio, making improvements to the design, content, 
                  and overall presentation to ensure that it properly reflects everything we have learned and accomplished.
