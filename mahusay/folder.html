            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Mahusay Marcus, and I am a student at Kapitolyo High School. I completed
                my work immersion alongside three classmates, where we gained valuable hands-on
                experience and strengthened our coding skills.
                This opportunity allowed me to develop both my technical knowledge and my ability
                to work effectively in a team environment.
                I plan to continue building on these skills as I pursue a degree in Information Technology.
                In the future, I aspire to establish my own computer business that provides affordable computers
                and computer parts, as well as reliable repair services for damaged units.

                    <h1>project 1</h1>
                    <p>
                       During our projects, we were assigned to report on different areas of coding, and I was selected
                        to present CSS and explain its role in designing and styling a website. For our first project,
                        we focused on HTML, where we built the basic structure of our website. This experience helped
                        me better understand how web pages are organized and strengthened my confidence in explaining
                        technical concepts clearly.

                    <h3>project 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        For our second project, I focused on designing and styling our HTML code using CSS, which
                        took me two days to complete. One of the most challenging parts for me was working with
                        JavaScript, particularly computing the date of birth and ensuring that the records displayed
                        correctly in the console. Despite the difficulty, I was able to understand the logic behind
                        it and successfully implement the required functionality.

                    <h3>project 3</h3>
                    <p>
                        For our third project, we worked with jQuery, which was the most challenging task for me because
                        we had to convert our JavaScript statements into jQuery. Although it was difficult at first,
                        I took the time to understand the differences and how the syntax works. In the end, I was able
                        to fully understand the concept and complete my work on time.
